# HideAndSeekGame
This is a project in relation to my maior project at Aberystwyth university where I'm developing a 2D game for iOS in Swift. My game is inspired by the classic game of Hide and seek and the recently popular game of â€˜Among Us'.

My game will be a single player game where the player is either the seeker or one of the hiders. When the game starts everyone will spawn around a campfire in a forest. The hiders are tasked with finding places to hide. After a certain amount of time has gone by the seeker will start seeking. The players will have limited vision, but if the players can see any light source (such as a campfire) they will be able to see further. The seeker will have one advantage where they can use a flashlight to expand their line of sight.
