# HideAndSeekGame
This is a project in relation to my maior project at Aberystwyth university where I'm developing a 2D game for iOS in Swift. My game is inspired by the classic game of Hide and seek and the recently popular game of ‘Among Us'.

My game will be a single player game where the player is either the seeker or one of the hiders. When the game starts everyone will spawn around a campfire in a forest at night. The hiders are tasked with finding places to hide. After a certain amount of time has gone by the seeker will start seeking. The players will have limited vision, but if the players can see any light source (such as a campfire) they will be able to see further. The seeker will have one advantage where they can use a flashlight to expand their line of sight.

Here are some of the important features of the game:
- I want to implement endurance. This will work on the basis that certain hiding places (like hiding in a tree or in a lake) will make the character tired, so they can’t stay there for more than a given period of time. If this time runs out, they will start taking damage.
- Health is going to be a minor thing in the game as well. Every person has a certain amount of health and if they lose all their health (e.g. through running out of air while hiding in a lake) they will lose the game.
- Certain hiding spots will not cause the character to endure harm, however they will make a small noise every so often, risking their exposure to the seeker.
- The seeker will be equipped with a flashlight which will give them a longer line of sight, but this can also be used to look into hiding spots like tents or bushes. 
- Batteries will be a crucial part for the seeker. When the seeker is using the flashlight it will slowly lose power and if the batteries run out it will no longer be able to be used.
